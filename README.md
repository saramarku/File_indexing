# File_indexing
#CSC-213-Project


Our program intents to find the files that contain the given word, inside
the given paths.

First the user needs to give the full path of a directory where he/she
wants to search for the word.
After the path is given the user is asked to give the word he/she is
searching for.
The output of the program prints all the paths inside that directory that
contain that word.

 For example when you run the program and the word is found:

> Please indicate the path of directory you want to search
/home/markusar/Desktop
Received command: /home/markusar/Desktop
> Please indicate the word you want to search for
Hello
Received command: Hello
Hello is found in the following files: 
/home/markusar/Desktop/213-project-test/test2.txt
/home/markusar/Desktop/213-project-test/test1.txt
/home/markusar/Desktop/csc151/213-project-test.txt

 When the word is not found:

> Please indicate the path of directory you want to search
/home/markusar/Desktop
Received command: /home/markusar/Desktop 
> Please indicate the word you want to search for

Received command: dkghksh
